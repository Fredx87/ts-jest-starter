# Jest type starter

Project pre-configured for running test using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [ts-jest](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/).

Run `npm install`, write your tests (naming the file with `.test.ts` or `spec.ts` extension) and then run `npm test` to run all tests, or `npm run test:watch` to watching tests for change.

The project contains also the configurations for debbugging tests on Visual Studio Code.
